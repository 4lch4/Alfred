# Alfred Modules

The modules directory contains/will contain the various libraries/modules that I've written for use with the primary Alfred project. The primary project (@4lch4/Alfred) will interfact/connect with my OpenHAB installation and use it for proper automation.

## Hue Lights

The very first module to be added is the `@4lch4/alfred-hue-lights` module. It's responsible for interacting with Philips Hue Lights and setting their colors, brightness, and more.
